UGME
----

The ``ugme`` is a software for building and analyzing
time-convolutionless generalized master equation models of biomolecular
dynamics. We developed this method to directly include short-time memory
effects in reduced dynamical models that recover long-time kinetics from
short-time simulations.

**Overview**

Our U-GME framework provides a way to incorporate non-Markovian effects
into reduced dynamical models while retaining a compact description of
the dynamics. We further introduce a simple averaging procedure to tame
the noise from underconverged correlation matrices.

This repository contains tools for: - Estimating time-local memory
functions from a time-series of transition probability matrices (TPMs),
:math:`C(t)` - Computing the time-local generator :math:`U(t)` from the
:math:`C(t)` - Characterizing memory plateau :math:`\tau_R` timescales
with the RMSE error metric (in the absence of noise) - Identifying
optimal onset (:math:`t_r`) and offset :math:`(\tau_R)` of averaging for
the time-local propagator U(t) - Propagating the long-time dynamics of
the TPMs with the resulting
:math:`U_\infty(\delta t) \equiv U(t \geq \tau_R)`.
